                    Cool, overcast, a lite mist, surrounded by the scampering denizens of the forest, "Be careful, the bridges are slick", an older gentleman walking his dog, nicely calls out as I begin my ride. True enough I'll eventually find out how slick they can be, but it's been more than awhile since I've gone out for a 'good' ride and I'm always on the cautious side.

                <p>
                    This is supposed to be more about coding things, but the ride did seem to help me refocus a bit. I've been a bit scatter-brained trying to get all the things on my ever growing to-do-list. I've now hopefully got a consistent plan of attack for my 'inbetween' and 'ongoing' personal-technical development.

                    Using this site as a guinea pig, I'll be going through most of the front-end content from my time at NSS to brush up and refine my Javascript/HTML/CSS skills and plan out recreating my front-end capstone project <a href="https://github.com/wpruitt/storyseed">Story Seeds</a> as my first big objective. The <a href="projs.html">projects page</a> should soon contain a to-do list of projects I want to work on and descriptions to help me keep track of, quantify, and make tangible my floating and invisible idea.

                <p>Being able to slow down, and organize my thoughts has been great. From the position of being given specific tasks and objectives, a somewhat frantic pacing can be beneficial, but now back to being the architect, planner, and implementer, I haven't been allowing myself to step back and analyze the entirety of my ambitions and objectives.....<br>being back in the saddle seems to be helping that.</p>
                <div class="blog-pic-container"></div>
                <p>In between rides I was able to make it to the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nashjs/events/241564510/">NashJS meetup</a> with talks on Babel and Voice Assistants. I'm looking forward to diving a bit deeper into both, but I'm excited about playing with voice assistants and have some pretty specific ideas for implementing them into a couple future projects.</p>

                <p>This weekend was good on a few levels. Only one ride was had &#8682;, but the weekend was fun, relaxing, and conceptually productive.<br>
                <br>
                Firstly... Capoeira. It has been a good while since the last time I was able to play with anyone else, having Lino over to prompt us this weekend was fantastic. Being able to see the progress I've made, esecially in regards to being willing to throw kicks and get in close without the fear of being kicked/hit. Whether that actually translates into a better or less visually akward game, we'll see. Hopefully this weekend with B & R in town, maybe I'll get a bit of video to take a look at.</p>
                <p>With B & R coming into town, I've set a deadline to have <a href="https://github.com/wpruitt/storyseed">Story Seeds</a> up and running by Friday. I'll be rewriting it in AngularJS with a focus on refining existing features and initial readability, and don't forsee any roadblocks outside of the same future usage of Firebase and what I perceived were limitations on future expansion of features. I'll be spending a good portion of my non-job-hunt time combing through code with pen and paper and replanning my object and module designs.</p>
