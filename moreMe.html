                    Cool, overcast, a lite mist, surrounded by the scampering denizens of the forest, "Be careful, the bridges are slick", an older gentleman walking his dog, nicely calls out as I begin my ride. True enough I'll eventually find out how slick they can be, but it's been more than awhile since I've gone out for a 'good' ride and I'm always on the cautious side.

                    This is supposed to be more about coding things, but the ride did seem to help me refocus a bit. I've been a bit scatter-brained trying to get all the things on my ever growing to-do-list. I've now hopefully got a consistent plan of attack for my 'inbetween' and 'ongoing' personal-technical development.

                    Using this site as a guinea pig, I'll be going through most of the front-end content from my time at NSS to brush up and refine my Javascript/HTML/CSS skills and plan out recreating my front-end capstone project <a href="https://github.com/wpruitt/storyseed">Story Seeds</a> as my first big objective. The <a href="projs.html">projects page</a> should soon contain a to-do list of projects I want to work on and descriptions to help me keep track of, quantify, and make tangible my floating and invisible idea.
